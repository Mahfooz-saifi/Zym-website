            <h1>Andrei Deiu..</h1>
            <p class="ss">Andrei Deiu hasn't always been the active, and healthy person he’s been known as. In his
                younger years, he used to play a lot of video games, and eat of junk food. At the time, Andrei didn’t
                think too much about the possible health implications this lifestyle might have had for his future.

                As his weight slowly started to increase, his confidence started to drop. It wasn’t only his weight
                which pulled his confidence down, he also suffered from bullying in high school. This only made Andrei
                feel worse.

                Andrei realized he had to do something about the bullying and his weight, this, as Andrei recalls,
                “that’s how I got started.”
                
                Starting his journey into fitness, he wasn’t sure of the outcome, Andrei said; “In the beginning, I
                wasn’t very confident about the outcome of my journey, and everything seemed impossible to me.” With no
                idea about nutrition or training, he went at it alone.</p>
